  <p>Since you'll be working with a partner on this, let's talk about some strategies to help you get the most out of your partnership.</p>
  <p>Professional programmers frequently work in pairs on the same computer, with the following roles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Driver:</b> the person actually using the mouse and/or keyboard, analogous to the driver in a car.</li>
    <li><b>Navigator:</b> the person giving the driver directions and suggestions, since the driver shouldn't be looking at a map/their phone/etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This might feel a little strange at first, but a good way to think about this is that the person who has an idea of how to solve the problem at hand should <i>never</i> be driving.</p>
  <div id="code">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> If you have an idea and you are driving, have your navigator take over at the keyboard and explain the idea to them.</p>
  </div><!-- code -->
  <p>Talk a lot! Communication is key when you're working with a partner.</p>
