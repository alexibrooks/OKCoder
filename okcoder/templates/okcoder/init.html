<h4>Description of the research</h4>
<p>You are invited to participate in a research study about effective pair programming partnerships between students learning to program. You have been asked to participate because you are enrolled in a course which is using the OKCoder online programming exercise tool. The purpose of the research is to learn about the individual characteristics of effective pair programming partners, which will support creation of a matching algorithm to suggest effective partnerships to future users of tools like the one you're using today. This study will include students enrolled in courses which use OKCoder. The research will occur online using data generated by OKCoder, and you will have no additional responsibilities beyond those you will be completing for your coursework. <b>Your instructor will not have any information on whether or not you have chosen to participate in the study.</b></p>
<p>If you consent, your data may be used regardless of whether or not your paired partner participates. <b>Other people in the class will not know whether or not you are participating.</b></p>
<p>Your progress in the programming exercises as assigned for lab will be logged, as will your anonymous evaluations of your experiences working with a partner. Only authorized research staff will have access to identifying information, which will not be used in any publications which may be generated from this study. The logged data will be kept on secure, password-protected servers for seven years after the completion of the study. After the seven years have elapsed, all data and consent forms will be destroyed.</p>

<h4>What will my participation involve?</h4>
<p>If you decide to participate in this research, you will not need to complete any additional tasks beyond those you will already be completing for class. Participation means that you consent to allow the researchers to examine and analyze your use of the tool and your (anonymized) progress in a lab assignment, so that they may improve future performance of the tool.</p>

<div class="info" id="risks">
<h4>Are there any risks to me?</h4>
<p>We don't anticipate any risks to you from participation in this study; your data will be completely anonymized during the study so there will not be any risk of breach of confidentiality beyond normal usage of the tool.</p>
</div><!-- risks -->

<div class="info" id="benefits">
<h4>Are there any benefits to me?</h4>
<p>We don't expect any direct benefits to you from participation in this study.</p>
</div><!-- benefits -->

<div class="info" id="confidentiality">
<h4>How will my confidentiality be protected?</h4>
<p>Your use of this tool will be recorded using a randomly-generated ID. Your identity will not be used in any publications that may result from this study, and will not be known by the researchers. <b>The instructor of this course will not know your consent status.</b> There is no possibility that participation in this study could have an effect on your grade in the course, as the instructor will not know who has consented. </p>

<div class="info" id="contact">
<h4>Whom should I contact if I have any questions?</h4>
<p>You may ask any questions about the research at any time. If you have questions about the research, you should contact the Principal Investigator Prof. Matthew Berland at (608) 263-4600 or mberland@wisc.edu.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the response of the research team, have more questions, or want to talk with someone about your rights as a research participant, you should contact the Education and Social/Behavioral Science IRB Office at (608) 263-2320.</p>
<p>Your participation is entirely voluntary. If you begin participation and change your mind you may end your participation at any time with no effect on your grade.</p>
<p>Your virtual signature below indicates that you have read this consent form, had an opportunity to ask any questions about your participation in this research, and voluntarily consent to participate. You may print a copy of this form for your records.</p>
